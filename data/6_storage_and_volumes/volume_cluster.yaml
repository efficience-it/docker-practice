    question: What happens if a service using a `local` volume is rescheduled to another node in Swarm?
    answers:
      - { value: "The container starts, but the data will not be present on the new node", correct: true }
      - { value: "Docker automatically migrates the data", correct: false }
      - { value: "Swarm blocks the scheduling until storage syncs", correct: false }
      - { value: "The volume becomes globally accessible via overlay", correct: false }
