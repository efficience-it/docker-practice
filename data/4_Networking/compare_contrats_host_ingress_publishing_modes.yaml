    question: In Docker Swarm, what is the "ingress" publishing mode used for?
    answers:
      - { value: "To allow any node in the swarm to route traffic to the service", correct: true }
      - { value: "To bind container ports directly to the host", correct: false }
      - { value: "To expose the service only internally", correct: false }
      - { value: "To run services in bridge mode", correct: false }

    question: What is a potential downside of using "host" publishing mode?
    answers:
      - { value: "You must manually manage which node receives traffic", correct: true }
      - { value: "There is no support for load balancing", correct: false }
